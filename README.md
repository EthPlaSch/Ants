# Ants

This project was an exploration of Ant Colony Optimisation.

The main project is using a version of someone elses code (reference at the top of the file).
The project was a small game / simulation just involves clicking on the screen to place dots,
then clicking solve to see a partially optimised path

The side project is a simulation of ants a their foragaing behaviours to get a better sense of 
how the algorithm functions. The project is incomplete and not very effect, but it still provides 
a cool visual.
